Aaaaand before we knew it, another year has passed.



With the demo release finally announced, this seems like a good point to wrap up our year here at Somnova. This year has had no shortages of challenges big and small, but we're glad to have been able to overcome them, and we're glad for the lessons they taught us. As 2018 comes knocking and the team enters a new phase of development for the visual novel, once again we'd like to thank you for the support, encouragement, and the occasional shitpost. We promise to do our darnedest to give you the best game we possibly can.



Here's to a brighter year ahead for all of us!
