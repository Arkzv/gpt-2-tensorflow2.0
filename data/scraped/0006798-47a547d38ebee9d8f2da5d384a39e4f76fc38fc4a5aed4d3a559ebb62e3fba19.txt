GOP Lawmakers Set Jan. 3rd for FBI, DOJ to Comply with Subpoena on Phony Trump Dossier (Video)

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) is tired of waiting for Deep State to turn over subpoenaed documents.

Nunes and GOP lawmakers on the Intel Committee have given the Department of Justice and FBI until next Wednesday to turn over requested documents on the phony Trump dossier.

Nunes slammed the Deep State last week for failing to produce the documents as required by law back in August.

“Unfortunately, DOJ/FBI’s intransigence with respect to the Aug. 24 subpoenas is part of a broader pattern of behavior that can no longer be tolerated. As a result of the numerous delays and discrepancies that have hampered the process of subpoena compliance, the committee no longer credits the representations made by DOJ and/or the FBI regarding these matters.”

Rep. Ron Desantis (R-FL) joined Trish Regan on Sunday morning Futures to discuss the Deep State resistance with Congressional investigators.
