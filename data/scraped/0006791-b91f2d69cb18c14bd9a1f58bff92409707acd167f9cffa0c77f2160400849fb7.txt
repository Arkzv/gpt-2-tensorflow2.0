2017 is just about over, which means it's time to rank the best anime of the year! We're putting together a big feature on the best anime series of 2017, and that means we need your input.Below is an extensive list of every new or returning TV series in 2017, including shorts, in alphabetical order. The list is limited to anime TV series that started new seasons in 2017, so films, OVAs, and long-running series like One Piece are not eligible. Pick your 5 favorite shows, and this will help us compile a top 5 list of the most popular shows of the year, to be used in our larger feature. We'll also make the poll results available when the big feature goes live, for those curious. If there's a show you wanted to vote for that we overlooked, please email [email protected] and let us know. We'll add it to the list if it aired in 2017 and meets our other requirements. Thanks for voting!
