These are the best speakers Iâ€™ve heard so far, even better than the JBL LSR305s. The sound is extremely detailed and transparent, but not fatiguing at all. The imaging is spectacular. The bass is weaker than expected for the size -and the woofers are closer to 5.5 inches, not the 7 inches they claim-, but it's good enough for most music. I'd add a sub if this is going for home theater usage. These speakers are easy to drive. I get away with 35 wpc in a small room.
