Shakshuka (שַׁקְשׁוּקָה) is a very healthy, Israeli recipe (matkon - מַתְכּוֹן) of fried eggs cooked with tomatoes and peppers.

The Ingredients:

2-4 tbsp water (as much as you need).

The Instructions

Cut bell pepper, tomatoes, parsley, onion, garlic, and put each vegetable in a different bowl (The size of the pieces doesn’t matter, it’s a personal choice).

Heat Olive oil in a frying pan (mahvat - מַחֲבַת) above a large flame (le’hava - לֶהָבָה). Add onion to the frying pan and stir until it gets a golden shade (gavan - גָּוֶן). Add garlic and stir. Add bell pepper and stir for 4 minutes.

Add to the frying pan tomatoes and parsley and stir while it cooks, until the tomatoes are soft. (troubleshooting: if the tomatoes doesn’t give off enough water, add 2-4 tbsp water). Add salt, black pepper and paprika, stir again and boil. Cover the frying pan partly and lower the flame. Cook for 10 minutes.

Remove the cover and increase the flame. With a spoon (kaf - כַּף), create 4 dimples in the mixture and put 1 egg (be’itsa - בֵּיצָה) in each dimple (gooma - גֻּמָּה). Cover the frying pan and let the eggs cook for 4-5 minutes.
