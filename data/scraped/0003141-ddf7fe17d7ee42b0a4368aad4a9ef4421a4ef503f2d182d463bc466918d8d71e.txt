Picked this up after seeing the Don Cheadle directed/starrer 'Miles Ahead' which is a fictionalized telling of a creatively fallow period in Davis's life. When I was in college I was a fan of the Digable Planets and their most popular single 'Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)' (1992) draws inspiration from this album-- and not just the title.



I've always found music reviews to be a bit problematic-- not every style is going to please everyone and what I consider seminal might just be 'meh' to someone else. It's a crap shoot. I've always found Davis's playing to be very 'athletic' and energizing to me as a listener, which belies the conventional wisdom of jazz as a sort of lackadaisical mess. I don't know why this album resonates with me so much, but Wikipedia says the pieces are inspired by classical techniques and forms and I like classical so maybe that's it?



'Boplicity', 'Jeru', and 'Venus de Milo' are standouts for me, and I recognized a few licks because the same or similar were probably sampled in early 90s hip hop/rap tracks. I found the last track, 'Darn that Dream' featuring vocals by Kenny Hagood, a bit jarring because of the vocals but really it's a good reminder of Davis' skill as a collaborator. He was able to hold his own on, or relinquish control of, any style of track.
