This is a great game with minimal bumps in its design. The 360 spherical movement is great and easy to use - just point in a direction and click and you start "falling" in that direction. There are plenty of powerups and enhancements you can use. My minor complaints are confusing talismans when trying to combine them, a couple side missions are hard, some of the main bosses are a bit redundant. Other than that, my complaint is I wish there was more of it. There's a cool indefinite game you can play when you see a picture taken online by someone else from somewhere in the game and you have to find this giant apple from where they took the picture.



The characters are fairly amusing and fun. Kat is a good female lead, not arrogant, not obnoxious, and there are other competent males too (even though the main fighters in the game are all female). Sometimes scriptwriters trip over their own quotas and end up with dumb characters, but this game was good about it.



I like the fighting in that I don't feel like I'm just button mashing. There are different, fairly simple tactics you can do. Either a basic square kick in the air or ground, or triangle if your pink meter fills up, and there are also some running kicks. Stasis is also fun, where you can pick up lighter objects and throw them with a single button too.



If they fine tune this game, the 3rd installment will be even better!
