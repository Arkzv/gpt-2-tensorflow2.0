A section of roof collapsed onto a couple vehicles and some equipment.

A large section of roof collapsed Friday night at the All-Weather Roofing Co., 1248 W. 17th St., in Erie, authorities said.

The company's owner was inside the building when a 30-foot-by-40-foot section of the metal roof collapsed under the weight of snow, Erie Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Carroll said.

The collapse was reported at 9:08 p.m. The owner — a man — was not injured, Carroll said.

"The trusses let go,'' Carroll said. "The trusses are all in. The owner was in there at the time and he heard it. He's been working here, and he's been cleaning other people's roofs from the weight of the snow and his own let go.''

Carroll said the section of roof collapsed onto a couple vehicles and some equipment.
