On December 31, SBS closed out their year with the 2017 SBS Drama Awards ceremony, hosted by Shin Dong Yeop and Lee Bo Young.

Unlike the MBC and KBS Drama Awards, the latter which aired at the same time as the 2017 SBS Drama Awards, SBS was not affected by strike issues this year. The broadcasting station also featured lots of crime thrillers this year in their miniseries, with many of their best-rated dramas falling in that genre.

Compared to previous years, when acting categories were given out according to genre, actors received awards according to their drama’s time slot (Monday-Tuesday, Wednesday-Thursday, or Daily/Weekend).

The biggest winners of the night were “Defendant,” “While You Were Sleeping,” “Sister Is Alive,” and “Whisper.” “Sister Is Alive” took home many acting awards across several categories, while “While You Were Sleeping” and “Whisper” netted acting awards for their leads. Comparatively “Defendant” took home less awards but in the most important categories, like Grand Prize and Best Picture.
