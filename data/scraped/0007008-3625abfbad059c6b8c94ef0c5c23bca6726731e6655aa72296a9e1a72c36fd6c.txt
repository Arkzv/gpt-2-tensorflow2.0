The streaming service Netflix is currently listing Kyoto Animation 's Violet Evergarden anime with a "new episode coming on January 11" in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. However, Netflix does not currently have a listing for the series in Japan and in the United States.

The show will premiere in Japan on January 10, and Netflix will stream the series worldwide. The show's official website still states that Netflix will stream the series inside Japan starting in January when the anime airs on Japanese television, and will then stream the series outside of Japan starting in spring 2018.

Kyoto Animation had announced at the first-episode screening of the anime at the C3 AFA Singapore event in November that Netflix will begin streaming the series in Singapore in January.

The listings outside of Japan are not definitively indicative of the show actually premiering on January 11 in those countries, as Netflix may have input incorrect premiere date information. The Netflix listings in these countries do not yet contain a logo for the series. Additionally, Netflix features English descriptions even for shows that do not have English subtitles or an English dub in non-English-speaking countries.
