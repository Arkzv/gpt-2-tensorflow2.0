A slim majority of Americans chose the word “worrisome” to describe the last year, according to a new online survey.

Fifty-two percent of respondents selected “worrisome” to characterize 2017 from a list of nine words, according to an Axios/SurveyMonkey poll released Sunday.

Both Republicans and Democrats selected the word as their top pick, with 64 percent of Democrats and 38 percent of Republicans choosing “worrisome.”

The second most popular word was “chaotic,” with 41 percent of respondents picking it to describe 2017.

The third most popular word among Democrats was “hellish” at 34 percent, while for Republicans it was the word “great,” at 28 percent.

Online surveys are not considered representative, in part because respondents are self-selected.
