I bought this for my son as a reward for doing well in school. He absolutely loves it and has played it multiple times in the two weeks he's had it.



The graphics and sound effects are well done and quite eerie and the minimal storyline is interesting, although for $19.99 the game is pretty darn short. There are some intense moments in there at least!



My son is 8 and beat the game again this evening over a couple hours. This makes the third or fourth time he's beaten it, but he keeps coming back to it because he enjoys it so much, so that's a plus in my book.
