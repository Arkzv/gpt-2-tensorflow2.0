In fact, Jackson and Dorsey were on board with working together during the six weeks the Browns were talking to him before Dorsey was hired.



But how things unfold in the next week or two will determine if Jackson stays or goes.



If Lewis walks away in Cincinnati, the Bengals would be interested in Jackson as their head coach, sources say.



That decision might not happen right away. Lewis and Bengals owner Mike Brown could take their time in deciding their next move, and some say Lewis might want to come back now for another year.



If he doesn't, and if Haslam, Dorsey and Jackson have any reservations about proceeding together at that point, perhaps the Browns and Bengals could try to work something out.



Jackson has three years remaining on his contract, at about $5 million a year.



He's repeatedly said he wants to remain in Cleveland and get the Browns to winning as fast as they can, but all parties must be committed to working together under the right conditions for this to make sense.
