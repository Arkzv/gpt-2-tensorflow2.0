i also have one of these and yes, windy days will make this product difficult to control, but if there is no wind, it's awsome. I agree that 20 minutes sounds correct to inflate, Although there was an instruction that came with it to blow it up by mouth, which i thought was a joke. there should also be better warnings with it as it can be dangerous. in my excitement with blowing it up for my niece and nephews (ages:3,7,8,10) i started things off by rolling it right a my 3 yo nephew and the weight of it knocked him right on his ass (crying ensued). then we realized that you CANNOT try to run away from it as it will trip up your feet and then face slam you into the ground (no matter how big you are). i never really thought about how heavy and dangerous a 12 ft beach ball can be. so if you are ever chased by a 12 ft beach ball, then just STOP, DROP, and let it ROLL right on over you. unfortunately learning this on your one can be a bit painful. once we all learned our lesson, it was AWESOME! i surely recomend this product, just follow my advice.
