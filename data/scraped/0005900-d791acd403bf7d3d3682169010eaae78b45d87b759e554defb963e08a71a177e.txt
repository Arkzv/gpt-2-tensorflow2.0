The weather caused a lot of issues for drivers on Friday, 12/29 in Muskegon Township when a 40-car-pileup shut down US-31 for a few hours.

The crash happened around 2 p.m. near the Holton Road exit. Muskegon Township Police Chief told FOX 17 that a spun-out vehicle plus white-out conditions started the chain-reaction and even affected cars driving north of the initial accident.

Jim Perreault, a resident of North Muskegon, was at the scene during the time of the accident and posted the video to Facebook showing what was happening in real time. It has now been shared over 100K times.

Perreault was in the ditch as he was recording the accidents. In the video you can see cars driving up the accident, trying to slow down and hitting other cars, including Perrault's car. Over 3 1/2 minutes, you can see the mess that occurred on US-31 Friday afternoon.

Thankfully, out of all of that, only three people [from the same vehicle] were sent to the hospital with minor injuries.
