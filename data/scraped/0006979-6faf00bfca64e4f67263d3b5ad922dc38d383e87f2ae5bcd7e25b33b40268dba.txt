Warren Buffett's top lieutenant, Charlie Munger, is a bitcoin skeptic.

Munger was asked for his views on cryptocurrencies during a University of Michigan's Ross School of Business event.

"I think it is perfectly asinine to even pause to think about them," Munger said. "It's bad people, crazy bubble, bad idea, luring people into the concept of easy wealth without much insight or work. That's the last thing on Earth you should think about … There's just a whole lot of things that aren't going to work for you. Figure out what they are and avoid them like the plague. And one of them is bitcoin. … It is total insanity."
