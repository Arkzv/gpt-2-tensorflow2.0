Iranian Revolutionary Guard crosses sides — joins protestors!

I just saw an amazing video, out of Iran, and the Revolutionary Guard commanders and soldiers sent to shoot the protestors — had crossed over — joined in with the protestors; in one giant celebration! Everybody was cheering and hugging each other, some of the soldiers were giving away medals from their uniforms to crying and cheering civilians. This was no intel op.

This was incredible to see and may not be happening everywhere, but it is happening in at least some of the protest sites, so, maybe, just maybe, one of the great evils in the world, has folded it’s tent.

I hate to blow my own horn at a time like this, but I predicted the Iranian mullahs big problem, years ago (after the 2009 uprising) was that they had a lot more to worry about from and for — their own people — than they did from the Great Satan, America.

Congrats to Trump, who has had the magic touch now for months — and may have removed a huge thorn in America’s side — with just a few tweets. Tweets in support of the Iranian people — not the Obama mullah supporting silence — that will forever be one of our national shames.

Who knows, maybe these protests have been in waiting now for 8 years — until the Great Satan elected a new president.
