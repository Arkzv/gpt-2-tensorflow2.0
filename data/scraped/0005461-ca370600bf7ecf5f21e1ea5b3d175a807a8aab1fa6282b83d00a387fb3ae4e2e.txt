I love these for shooters, the reason most are mad they dont buy the 1 year warranty of 20 dollars. So when it breaks down they can get another, just have the renew it for another 20 dollars. They last for about 6-8 months for me and i play 12-16 hrs a day. Best thing i can say to do is buy it and warranty. But buy it from a place u can get a refund, if u dont like it. Ive been using this remote since it came out and players always say i cheat in shooters when they play against me. I dont know how many reports i have because of this remote. But ive never had anything bad happen yet. The remote triggers have switches on bottom to decrease the time it take to fire in games. Lets say it takes u 1 secs to aim and fire a player, if u hit the switches it will .75 or .5 sec to aim and fire. Lots of players believe this is a cheat in games when its really this controller. Problems with controller, rubber degrades quick and thumb stick lose sensitivity, it has a connection to console issue.
