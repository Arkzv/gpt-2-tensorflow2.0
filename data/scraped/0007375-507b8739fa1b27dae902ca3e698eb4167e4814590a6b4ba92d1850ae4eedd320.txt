“In the near future, the entire world will recognize the state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, and this problem will cease to exist”, said the Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım on Saturday, during a speech at a Justice and Development (AK) Party event in the northwestern province.

“Both the Muslim world and the Christian world, in short humanity, looked out for the rightful cause of the Palestinians, which has been going on for years”, he added.

Since 6 December, thousands of Palestinians took to the streets of Gaza every day to protest against President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Many Arab leaders rejected Trump’s move, while European Union’s High Representative Francesca Mogherini said Europe will not follow the United States. “The European Union has a clear and united position. We believe the only realistic solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine is based on two states and with Jerusalem as the capital of both”, said Mogherini in a press conference on 7 December.

Few days ago, during a visit in Riyadh, Binali Yıldırım and Salman bin Abdulaziz invited the Islamic world to”act with unity” against the US decision and “emphasised the importance of Jerusalem’s status”.

During Saturday conference, the Turkey PM announced the resumption of US-Turkey visa services after nearly two months. “Relations have moved one step further towards normalization. The visa issue has finally been resolved”, said Yıldırım.
