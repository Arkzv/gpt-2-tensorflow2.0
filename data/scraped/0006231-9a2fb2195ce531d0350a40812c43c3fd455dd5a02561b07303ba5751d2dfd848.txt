Panel 5 there is one of my favorites in the whole series so far. The sketch and inking turned out just like in my head, and I'm very pleased with it, even though it's arguably a very simple panel. Springtrap's emotion showed up right.FNAF and all its characters belong to Scott Cawthon, not me.Previous:Next:PANEL 1:Fredbear: The good news is, I can help with this. Follow me back; there's still an active glitch out there, and I know the way directly back to Fazbear Hills.PANEL 2:Funtime Foxy: Please tell me you have a plan to keep him from doing nothing but screaming.Fredbear: I needed to speak to him again anyway. This just makes it a little more...urgent.PANEL 3:Spring Bonnie: *a-HEM*Fredbear: ...Yes, you can come help me talk to him.Spring Bonnie: Good, because if you tried to say no, I was gonna springlock you.Fredbear: We'll get everything sorted out. It just requires some time...PANEL 4:Fredbear, cont: ...And patience.PANEL 5:Springtrap: Me. Death. Explain.Spring Bonnie: Hey, didn't wake up screaming! Well, lost that bet.
