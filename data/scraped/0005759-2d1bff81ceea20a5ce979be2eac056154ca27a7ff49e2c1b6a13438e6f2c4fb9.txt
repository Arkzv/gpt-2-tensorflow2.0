2017 has come to an end, a year which marked a vast array of achievements and accomplishments for War Thunder, some of which include the addition of rank 6 for ground vehicles, French tanks and aircraft, Italian aircraft, and a whole heap of new vehicles and locations; we thank you for your feedback and support throughout the year!

Welcome to the future - to 2018! What’s our New Year’s resolution? Well, to continue developing and improving all aspects that make War Thunder great, of course! We would like to wish you and your loved ones happiness, health, and good fortune in the New Year!

Happy New Year, friends!
