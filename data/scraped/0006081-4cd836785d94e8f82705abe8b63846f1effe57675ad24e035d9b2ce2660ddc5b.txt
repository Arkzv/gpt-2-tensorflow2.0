Editor's Note by BWOT



Happy New Year MCME Community. It has been an absolutely great year of 2017 and that means an equally great edition of the Times. The editors of this edition are: @Arken,



We have a great edition this week so as usual in this edition is included all the regular sections but because it's the New Year edition we have some specials parts. A reminder, the editions will come out every two weeks and contain a project progress part and then an announcements part. This edition includes an interview with Happy New Year MCME Community.

Nice Progress on terrain Belfalas. I had some more time since Christmas days and voxelled a lot of cliffs near Dol Amroth. I’m progressing into the more steep hills now.

Nice Progress on terrain Belfalas. I had some more time since Christmas days and voxelled a lot of cliffs near Dol Amroth. I’m progressing into the more steep hills now. @barteldvn in organizing a plotbuild there to fix materials at the cliffs. Some more terrain smoothing plots in the north of Belfalas where finished. Thanks a lot to @DarkTempliers66 who is doing 150x150 block plots every few days. Some work on the streams near Ironmere has been done, thanks to all who helped with the job there.

@Fireinferno is back and @BWOT is now on the team. @Fireinferno is working on terrain at the N_Mordor warp and @BWOT is doing the terrain just on the Eastern Mordor border starting near Khand. Hopefully this work will go quickly and new textures will be made so the more exciting part of the Mordor project get underway.

Moria - Lead: @Despot | In Progress

Report by BWOT



I lot of progress has shown up in Eastern Moria as the team is trying to finish up the milestone. Ivan is back and halls, around Despot’s great hall (which looks amazing) are being built at a fast pace. Fire and BWOT are also working on their halls scattered in East Moria. Patrick has also begun building one of the big forges of Moria. The new textures are being used everywhere and the floors are becoming flatter than ever. The Central Dwelling has yet to be started but progress is going to be made soon in that main area.

Report by BWOT & Finrod



No progress has been made these last two weeks. As Minecraft 1.13 is not far away anymore and will bring many fundamental changes which in the worst case might break a lot of things of our very special Gondor 2.0 RP I (Finrod) want to wait with any further changes on it until we know more about the update. Instead focus now shifts to the Mordor pack which is direly awaited by the team working on the terrain in and around Mordor.
